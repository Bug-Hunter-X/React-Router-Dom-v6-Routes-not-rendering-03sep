# React Router Dom v6 Routes Not Rendering
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6: Routes failing to render components despite seemingly correct setup. The problem lies in a subtle detail often overlooked by developers new to React Router v6. 

The provided code snippets showcase the bug and its solution, clearly explaining the root cause and providing a working fix.

## Bug Description
The application structure looks correct. However, when run, only a blank page is displayed.  The browser console shows no errors. The issue is not related to component definitions, but rather how React Router v6 handles the `Routes` component. This is a tricky one for new users!
